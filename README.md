Breast cancer image classification.
This project showcases the application of machine learning for breast cancer classification. The SVM model yields promising results, with potential for further improvements through algorithm exploration and hyperparameter tuning.

Distribution of Malignant and Benign Tumors:

This count plot visualizes the distribution of tumor types in the dataset. The x-axis represents the tumor type (Benign or Malignant), while the y-axis shows the count of occurrences for each type.

Confusion Matrix:

The confusion matrix visualizes the performance of the SVM model in classifying the tumors. The matrix displays the actual versus predicted classifications, with true labels on the y-axis and predicted labels on the x-axis.
